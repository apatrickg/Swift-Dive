# Swift-Dive 

- Ran into CORS issues when working with the API so had to create a PROXY server via Heroku. As a result, site may hang just a bit while loading. 
- Implemented a dark/light mode toggle since I provided text boxes with general information about the artists from wikipedia. Line height and changing colors should make the text easier to read. 
- According to LightHouse, main threading and overreliance on third party code is am major issue despite performance being a 91 on GTX. 
- Added lazy loading to the videos to improve performance
